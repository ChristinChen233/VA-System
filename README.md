# Visualization Analysis System for Movie Data
- The original full data set I choose to use is [Top 100 popular movies from 2003 to 2022 (iMDB)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/georgescutelnicu/top-100-popular-movies-from-2003-to-2022-imdb). Specifically in VA system, I focus on displaying high income movies. So our data set is the sub data set that the income of those movies are all higher than 256.70.
